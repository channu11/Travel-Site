Hindu men, women, and children are often seen making their morning pujas (prayer offerings of food and flowers) in front of magnificent small and large stone deity images, some are ancient. Buddhists, with prayer wheels circling in their hands, are also observed making their daily Kora (walking meditations) around gleaming white stupas found in many parts of this religious city. Narrow, brick-paved curving alleys remind us of the vestiges of Medieval times among twentieth-century buildings.
